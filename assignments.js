//Tenary Operator
let population = Number(prompt("Whats your country's Population"))

population >= 33000000 ? console.log(`Your country is over populated`):console.log(`Your country is under populated`);


/**If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator
 to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'.
 Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
 one word changes between these two sentences!
 2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then
 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
